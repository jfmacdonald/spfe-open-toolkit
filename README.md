The SPFE Open Toolkit

To make it run:

Unpack the archive to a suitable location.
Create an environment variable SPFEOT_HOME and set it to the location of the spfe-ot directory. For example: SPFEOT_HOME=/home/yourname/spfe/spfe-ot
Add the spfe-ot directory to your path.
If not already installed, install Java.
If not already installed, install ANT and add it to your path.

To build the SPFE docs:

Go to the directory spfe/spfe-docs/build.
Enter: spfe spfe-docs-config.xml draft. The build will create a directory spfebuild in your home directory. The SPFE docs will be in /spfebuild/spfe-docs/output.
