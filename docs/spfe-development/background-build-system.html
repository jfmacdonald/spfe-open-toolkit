            <p>The SPFE build system has a modular architecture with four major stages, <a href="../spfe-docs-lists/feature_synthesis.html" class="default" title="A list of topics on a subject: Feature: synthesis">synthesis</a>, <a href="../spfe-docs-lists/feature_presentation.html" class="default" title="A list of topics on a subject: Feature: presentation">presentation</a>, <a href="../spfe-docs-lists/feature_formatting.html" class="default" title="A list of topics on a subject: Feature: formatting">formatting</a>, and <a href="../spfe-docs-lists/feature_encoding.html" class="default" title="A list of topics on a subject: Feature: encoding">encoding</a>.</p>

                  <p class="caption">An overview of the SPFE build system.</p>
               
               <img src="images/SPFE-flow.svg" alt="" title="">
            
            <p>The build tool for a SPFE build is a <b class="decoration-bold">Python</b> program called
                <b class="decoration-bold"><a href="getting-started.html" class="default" title="Concept: Getting started with the SPFE build system">spfe</a></b>. This script takes three parameters, a build command, the path to a content set configuration file,
            and a build type (either “draft” or “final”). It reads the
            specified configuration file, resolves any inclusions, and creates the following
            files:</p>
            <ol>
               <li>
                  <p>A fully resolved configuration file. This file is created in the subdirectory
                        <b class="decoration-bold"><a href="directory-structure.html" class="default" title="Concept: Build directory structure">config</a></b> under the <a href="directory-structure.html" class="default" title="Concept: Build directory structure">build directory</a>. This configuration file is passed to every script in
                    the rest of the build process, making all the relevant configuration information
                    available to all scripts. This allows the scripts to have a uniform interface,
                    which reduces the need to customize build rules when writing your
                    own scripts.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>A generated XSLT script file for each stage of the build. These files are
                    generated by creating a wrapper file that imports each script listed in the
                    appropriate sections of the configuration element
                    <b class="decoration-bold"><a href="../spfe-configuration-reference/_topic-type_scripts.html" class="default" title="Configuration setting: scripts">/topic-type/scripts</a></b>,
                    <b class="decoration-bold"><a href="../spfe-configuration-reference/_output-format_scripts.html" class="default" title="Configuration setting: scripts">/output-format/scripts</a></b>, and
                    <b class="decoration-bold"><a href="../spfe-configuration-reference/_object-type_scripts.html" class="default" title="Configuration setting: scripts">/object-type/scripts</a></b>. These generated scripts
                    are created in the <a href="directory-structure.html" class="default" title="Concept: Build directory structure">build directory</a>.</p>
               </li>
            </ol>
            <p>Next, the <b class="decoration-bold"><a href="getting-started.html" class="default" title="Concept: Getting started with the SPFE build system">spfe</a></b> build tool runs each stage of the build
            process.</p>
        
            <p>The order of operations for the build is as follows:</p>
            <ol>
               <li>
                  <p>Run the <a href="feature-synthesis.html" class="default" title="Feature: Synthesis">synthesis stage</a> for each topic set in turn in the
                    order they are listed in the
                    <b class="decoration-bold"><a href="../spfe-configuration-reference/_content-set_topic-sets.html" class="default" title="Configuration setting: topic-sets">/content-set/topic-sets</a></b> configuration setting.
                    This involved running the extract, merge,
                        resolve, toc, and <a href="feature-catalogs.html" class="default" title="Feature: Link Catalogs">link catalog</a> scripts for each topic set in turn. Running the scripts in
                    the order in which the topic sets are defined is important because it allows the
                    scripts of later topic sets to access the synthesis, tocs, and link catalogs of
                    the earlier topics. This is used, for instance, to generate <a href="feature-subject-list-topics.html" class="default" title="Feature: Subject List Topics">subject list topics</a> that draw from the entire content set.</p> 
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>Run the presentation stage for each <a href="../spfe-docs-lists/feature_topic20set.html" class="default" title="A list of topics on a subject: Feature: topic set">topic set</a> in the <a href="../spfe-docs-lists/feature_content20set.html" class="default" title="A list of topics on a subject: Feature: content set">content set</a> in turn. If there are
                    different presentation processes for different output media, each will be run in
                    turn.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>Run the formatting stage for each <a href="../spfe-docs-lists/feature_topic20set.html" class="default" title="A list of topics on a subject: Feature: topic set">topic set</a>
                    in the <a href="../spfe-docs-lists/feature_content20set.html" class="default" title="A list of topics on a subject: Feature: content set">content set</a> in turn. If there are multiple output
                    formats being built, each will be run in turn.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>Run the encoding stage for each <a href="../spfe-docs-lists/feature_topic20set.html" class="default" title="A list of topics on a subject: Feature: topic set">topic set</a>
                    in the <a href="../spfe-docs-lists/feature_content20set.html" class="default" title="A list of topics on a subject: Feature: content set">content set</a> in turn, if required.</p>
               </li>
            </ol>
            <p>The following build command are available:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>
                  <p>
                     <tt class="decoration-code">build</tt>: Generates a draft build. Output includes work-in-progress
                    information and an indication of draft status.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>
                     <tt class="decoration-code">clean</tt>: Removes all the temporary files and output files from
                    previous builds except for link catalog files.</p>
               </li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you make changes to scripts or configuration files, you should always run clean before
            building a new draft, since the dependency checking in the build does not cover the
            scripts and configuration file. If you don't see the changes you expect as the result of
            any change you have made, try running <tt class="decoration-code">-clean</tt> and run the build again. If
            you see a patterns of changes not being recognized without running <tt class="decoration-code">-clean</tt>
            please report this issue.</p>
