            <p>The <a href="../spfe-docs-lists/feature_presentation.html" class="default" title="A list of topics on a subject: Feature: presentation">presentation</a> step is the second phase of the <a href="background-build-system.html" class="default" title="Feature: How the build system works">SPFE build</a> process. It is responsible for creating the final text, organization, and behavior of the topics in a <a href="../spfe-docs-lists/feature_topic20set.html" class="default" title="A list of topics on a subject: Feature: topic set">topic set</a>. In essence, it is responsible for the information architecture of the topic set.</p>
            <p>The presentation stage take the set of topics created by the synthesis stage and prepares them to be presented in a particular information design. You may decide to present topics differently for different media. For instance, you may have one presentation routine that prepares topics for presentation online in media such as the Web, another for a local help system, and another that prepares the same topics to be presented in a static linear media such as paper or a PDF. The ability to apply different forms of presentation means you don't have to have your Web output arranged like your help systems or your PDF.</p>
            <p>The output of the presentation step becomes the input to the <a href="../spfe-docs-lists/feature_formatting.html" class="default" title="A list of topics on a subject: Feature: formatting">formatting</a> step, which is responsible for the appearance of the content in a particular media, such as HTML or PDF.</p>
