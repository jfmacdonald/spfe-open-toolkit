               <a href="../spfe-docs-lists/feature_synthesis.html" class="default" title="A list of topics on a subject: Feature: synthesis">Synthesis</a> is the first stage in the <a href="background-build-system.html" class="default" title="Feature: How the build system works">SPFE build</a> process. The job of the synthesis stage is to create a collection of fully resolved <a href="../spfe-docs-lists/feature_topic.html" class="default" title="A list of topics on a subject: Feature: topic">topic</a> files as input to the <a href="../spfe-docs-lists/feature_presentation.html" class="default" title="A list of topics on a subject: Feature: presentation">presentation</a> process. Fully resolved means:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>
                  <p>All conditions have been applied.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>All <a href="../spfe-docs-lists/feature_strings.html" class="default" title="A list of topics on a subject: Feature: strings">strings</a> and <a href="../spfe-docs-lists/feature_fragments.html" class="default" title="A list of topics on a subject: Feature: fragments">fragments</a> have been resolved.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>All syntactic sugar elements have been transformed to their general equivalents.
                    For instance the <b class="decoration-bold">note</b>,
                    <b class="decoration-bold">caution</b>, and
                    <b class="decoration-bold">warning</b> admonitions have been transformed
                    into admonition elements with the appropriate signal word.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>All subject affinities have been fully resolved.</p>
               </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The synthesis stage also includes the extract and merge operations, for those cases where content is being extracted from source files, and (where applicable) being merged with authored content to create complete topics.</p>
            <p>Additionally, the <a href="../spfe-docs-lists/feature_synthesis.html" class="default" title="A list of topics on a subject: Feature: synthesis">synthesis</a> stage generates <a href="feature-catalogs.html" class="default" title="Feature: Link Catalogs">link catalogs</a> and toc files which are used by the <a href="../spfe-docs-lists/feature_presentation.html" class="default" title="A list of topics on a subject: Feature: presentation">presentation</a> stage to link and organize content. </p>
