            <h1>Build directory structure</h1>

            <p>The build systems produces a directory structure inside the build directory. Understanding the build directory structure can help you debug problems with the build.</p>
        
            <p>By default, the build directory is named <b class="decoration-bold">spfebuild</b> and is created in the user's home directory. You can change the location of the build directory by setting the environment variable <tt class="decoration-code">SPFE_BUILD_DIR</tt>.</p>
        
            <p>The build script creates a directory for the content set being built, which is named
            using the content set id (configured in
            <b class="decoration-bold"><a href="../spfe-configuration-reference/_content-set_content-set-id.html" class="default" title="Configuration setting: content-set-id">/content-set/content-set-id</a></b>). Inside this directory it
            creates a directory named <b class="decoration-bold">config</b> which contains the
            consolidated <a href="configuration-file-overview.html" class="default" title="Concept: Configuration file overview">configuration file</a>, with the name
                <b class="decoration-bold">spfe-config.xml</b>.</p>
        
            <p>The build then creates two additional directories in the content set directory,
                <b class="decoration-bold">build</b>, where all the temporary files used by the
            build are created, and <b class="decoration-bold">output</b>, where the output is
            created.</p>
        
            <p>Inside the <b class="decoration-bold">build</b> directory, there are three directories,
                <b class="decoration-bold">catalogs</b>, where the <a href="feature-catalogs.html" class="default" title="Feature: Link Catalogs">link catalogs</a> are created, <b class="decoration-bold">topic-sets</b>, where
            the each stage of the topic set build is created, and
                <b class="decoration-bold">tocs</b>, where the temporary TOC files are created.
            The link catalogs and temporary TOCs are located outside of the topic set directories
            because they are used by all topic set builds.</p>
        
            <p>Inside the <b class="decoration-bold">topic-sets</b> directory, a directory is created for each topic set in the build, with its name matching the <b class="decoration-bold"><a href="../spfe-configuration-reference/_topic-set_topic-set-id.html" class="default" title="Configuration setting: topic-set-id">topic-set-id</a></b> of each topic set.</p>
        
            <p>Inside each of these topic set directories, the following files and directories are created:</p>
        
            <ul>
               <li>
                  <p>A build flag for each stage of the build. The build flag is used by the build for
                    dependency checking purposes. </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>A directory named after each step in the build process (extract, merge, resolve,
                    presentation, etc.). Each directory contains the generated scripts for that step
                    and an out directory that hold the result of the step (except for the steps that
                    produce the final output, where the output goes to the content set output
                    directory.  </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>The <b class="decoration-bold">image-list.txt</b> file, which is used to copy image files used in the topic set to the output directory.</p>
               </li>
            
            </ul>
