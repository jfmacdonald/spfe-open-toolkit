         <h3>Summary</h3>
               <p xmlns="">Every Page is Page One is an approach to information design and information
                architecture that recognizes that readers may enter a content set at any point, and
                so ensure that every page in the content set can function as page one for the
                reader. </p>
            </div>
            <p>In a <a href="bottom-up-ia.html" class="default" title="Essay: Bottom-up Information Architecture">bottom-up information architecture</a> every page is a potential
            entry point and also a hub of its local space within the <a href="../spfe-docs-lists/feature_content20set.html" class="default" title="A list of topics on a subject: Feature: content set">content set</a>.
            A page is therefore not an end point, as it is in a
            <a href="bottom-up-ia.html" class="default" title="Essay: Bottom-up Information Architecture">top-down information architecture</a>, but a node in a network that the
            reader can navigate in any order they please. This meas that the reader can arrive at
            any page in the <a href="../spfe-docs-lists/feature_content20set.html" class="default" title="A list of topics on a subject: Feature: content set">content set</a> without any prior context being
            established. Each page must therefore work as page one for the reader. This is true even
            if the reader has visited several pages in the content set, since it is impossible to
            anticipate which pages, and in which order, the reader will have read those pages. </p>
            <p>Even in a top-down information architecture, however, it cannot be assumed that the
            reader will read in the prescribed order. (Nor does top-down architecture always imply a
            reading order -- it may be based on categorization rather than a curriculum.) The way in
            which the reader reads is driven by their background, habits, and immediate needs.
            Studies show that readers often skip around in material that was written to be read
            linearly (and indeed, we provide  indexes to help them do so). Given this, unless we are
            confident that the reader will actually read our content in linear order, we should
            still treat every page as page one, even in a top-down information architecture. </p>
            <p>Every Page is Page One is therefore an information design style based on creating small
            units of content (topics) that meet individual needs for the reader
            and that don't depend on being read in a particular order. In my book,
            <a href="http://xmlpress.net/publications/eppo" class="default" title="">Every Page is Page One: Topic-based Writing for Technical Communication and the Web</a>,
            I lay out seven design principles for Every Page is Page One topics:</p>
            <ol class="labeled-list">
               <li><p><b>Self-contained - </b>An Every Page is Page One topic is self contained. It contains the content needed
                    to fulfil its purpose for its intended audience and does not have linear
                    dependencies on other topics. That is, there is no previous or next topic, and
                    no parent or child topics. It may, however, link to topics that provide
                    supporting or ancillary material.  </p></li>
               <li><p><b>Specific and limited purpose - </b>An Every Page is Page One topic serves a specific and limited purpose. This
                    purpose is not necessarily the whole of any one user's task. Just as a traveller
                    may need to take several vehicles to complete a complex individual journey, a
                    reader may need to read several topics to complete a complex individual task.
                    Just as a hotel shuttle may sever the specific and limited purpose of getting
                    the traveller from the airport to the hotel, a topic should serve a specific and
                    well defined purpose within the reader's overall task.</p></li>
               <li><p><b>Establish context - </b>Because we don't know what the reader has read before reading this topic, we
                    cannot assume that they understand the context of the topic. A topic cannot
                    assume that its context is established by its place in a larger narrative or in
                    a hierarchical organizational scheme. It must establish its context for itself.
                    Establishing context is also an important part of enabling the reader who is
                    offered this topic as one of a set of search results to quickly establish that
                    it is the most relevant topic in the list for their needs. Finally, if the
                    reader is not actually reading the right topic, setting context helps them
                    identify this quickly. Context setting material should also provide links to
                    help readers who are not in quite the right place get where they need to go.
                </p></li>
               <li><p><b>Conform to a consistent pattern - </b>When you write a self contained topic with a specific and limited purpose, topics
                    on the same subject naturally contain the same types of information, generally
                    presented in the same way and in the same order. Thus all recipes follow the
                    same pattern. While patterns naturally emerge over time, a process we can see in
                    accelerated form in Wikipedia in particular, you can and should develop
                    consistent topics patterns deliberatly for your content. Having a consistent and
                    appropriate topic pattern helps to make the content more readable, easier for
                    the browsing reader to identify, and easier for the writer to make complete and
                    consistent. </p></li>
               <li><p><b>Stay on one level - </b>Readers often need to change levels as they read. Some like to start with general
                    principles and then see them illustrated by examples. Others like to start with
                    examples and proceed to general principles later. Readers perusing specific
                    goals often start with concrete instructions but find they need background
                    information to understand how to the instructions apply to their task. Part of
                    the curriculum design of a linear work is deciding when to change levels.
                    However, when your are creating Every Page is Page One topics, that are designed
                    to be accessed at random. the decision to change levels is firmly in the hands
                    of the reader, not the writer. Writers should cede control over levels to the
                    reader by keeping each topic they write on one level. Writers should also help
                    readers to change levels when they need to by providing appropriate links.</p></li>
               <li><p><b>Assume the reader is qualified - </b>For an Every Page is Page One topic to effectively serve a specific and limited
                    purpose, it must have a specific vision of the reader in mind.  A topic that
                    attempted to server all possible readers would have to explain every word and
                    idea that it mentioned, which would quickly become unwieldy. Instead, a topic
                    should be written for the type of person who normally does this task. For
                    example, a recipe is write for experienced cooks who know what terms like
                    "whisk," "blanch," and "puree" mean. Explaining those terms in every recipe
                    would make them inconvenient to use for the typical recipe user -- an
                    experienced cook. Readers who are not qualified can find out how to whisk,
                    blanch, or puree by searching or by following links in the recipe (if you
                    provide such links).</p></li>
               <li><p><b>Link richly - </b>Because an Every Page is Page One topic is a navigational hub for topics on
                    related subjects, and because it uses links to help readers establish context,
                    switche levels, and access background material, it should be richy linked to
                    surrounding material. </p></li>
            </ol>
            <p>In a <a href="structured-content.html" class="default" title="Essay: What is structured content?">structured writing</a> environment such as SPFE, the rule that an
            EPPO topic should follow a consistent pattern is supported by the creating of specific
            topic types for each of the EPPO topic patterns you need for your content. Topic types
            follow topic patterns, but they can be much more specific than topics patterns, and
            enforce specific requirements and constraints to meet specific
            business needs.</p>
            <p>The EPPO-simple schema set is specifically designed to support the
            development of highly specific EPPO topic types with minimal expense and overhead.</p>
