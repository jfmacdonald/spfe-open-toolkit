         <h3>Summary</h3>
               <p xmlns="">SPFE Open Toolkit uses namespaces extensively. Namespaces express the ownership of a
                document type. They do not guarantee that an element name is globally unique, or
                even unique within a namespace. Some XML vocabularies assign one namespace to a
                single document type. The SPFE Open Toolkit assigns one namespace to a set of
                related document types and used a chameleon schema model for building schemas from
                component pieces. However, you can use namespace however you like when creating your
                own schemas. </p>
            </div>
            <p>SPFE Open Toolkit makes extensive use of XML namespaces. It does not force your to
            use namespaces for your own content, but I do recommend that you do. You have some
            choices in how you use namespaces. The way they are used in EPPO-simple and the SPFE
            documentation is one choice, but there are others. The purpose of this essay is to
            explain the choices and why EPPO-simple and the SPFE documentation use namespaces the
            way they do.</p>

               <h2>Understanding namespaces</h2>
               <p>XML Namespaces are a source of considerable confusion. This is not because they are
                complex, but because they are simpler than we expect them to be, and because, as a
                late edition to the XML family, they are not treated entirely consistently across
                other XML technologies. They do less than we expect them to, and they do it in
                inconsistent ways. Nonetheless, they perform an important function.</p>
               <p>The function of XML namespaces is to provide an expanded name for an XML element that
                can distinguish it from the same local name used in other XML vocabularies. Thus,
                for instance, the name <b class="decoration-bold">element</b> is used in both
                XML schema and in XSLT. In XML Schema is it used to define an element name in a
                schema. In XSLT it is used to create a new element in the output. Despite having the
                same name, they are different elements because the
                <b class="decoration-bold">element</b> in XML schema is in the
                    <b class="decoration-bold">http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema</b>
                namespace and the <b class="decoration-bold">element</b> in XSLT is in the
                    <b class="decoration-bold">http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform</b>
                namespace. Similarly, many different XML vocabularies define elements with names
                like <b class="decoration-bold">title</b>,
                <b class="decoration-bold">name</b>,
                <b class="decoration-bold">section</b>,
                <b class="decoration-bold">link</b>, or
                <b class="decoration-bold">table</b>. By giving each of those vocabularies a
                different namespace, you can tell which <b class="decoration-bold">title</b>,
                <b class="decoration-bold">name</b>,
                <b class="decoration-bold">section</b>,
                <b class="decoration-bold">link</b>, or
                <b class="decoration-bold">table</b> you are looking at. Namespaces names are
                intended to be globally unique, so there should be no confusion about which vocabulary
                each element name belongs to. </p>
               <p>This makes is sound like namespaces make element names unique in the world. But they
                don't, and this is one possible source of confusion. Namespace names themselves are
                supposed to be globally unique. This is why they are usually based on domain names,
                since domain names are guaranteed to be globally unique thanks to the global domain
                name registration system. (Note that there is no global registry for XML namespaces
                themselves.) But adding a globally unique namespace name to an XML element name does
                not make that element name globally unique, because XML element names are not unique
                within their own namespace. </p>
               <p>In fact, the same element name can occur several times in an XML vocabulary, and
                can mean different things in each case. A common example is to have an element named
                <b class="decoration-bold">name</b> which is used to capture the name of
                several different things described by the vocabulary. In the SPFE configuration
                vocabulary, for example, there are several elements named
                <b class="decoration-bold">name</b>, and every one of them is part of the SPFE
                configuration namespace,
                    <b class="decoration-bold">http://spfeopentoolkit.org/ns/spfe-ot/config</b>.
                What distinguishes them is their position relative to other elements in a
                configuration document. They include: </p>
               <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                        <b class="decoration-bold"><a href="../spfe-configuration-reference/_topic-type_name.html" class="default" title="Configuration setting: name">/topic-type/name</a></b>
                     </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                        <b class="decoration-bold"><a href="../spfe-configuration-reference/_content-set_output-formats_output-format_name.html" class="default" title="Configuration setting: name">/content-set/output-formats/output-format/name</a></b>
                     </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                        <b class="decoration-bold"><a href="../spfe-configuration-reference/_topic-set_topic-types_topic-type_name.html" class="default" title="Configuration setting: name">/topic-set/topic-types/topic-type/name</a></b>
                     </p>
                  </li>
               </ul>
               <p>So, having a element name and namespace does not tell you what that element means, or
                even which element it is. For that, you have to know both the namespace and the
                context in which the element occurs.</p>
               <p>Namespaces, therefore, are not about uniquely identifying an element. Namespaces are
                actually about ownership. A namespace name tells you who the element name belongs
                to. Whether or not the name is unique within the namespace is entirely up to the
                person who owns the namespace. (And yes, that does mean that, technically speaking, XML namespaces are not really namespaces.)</p>
               <p>Typically, ownership of a namespace is expressed in terms of the organization and the
                project within that organization that created the vocabulary that the namespace is
                assigned to. Thus the namespace identifier,
                    <b class="decoration-bold">http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema</b> states
                that it belong to the W3C and to the XML Schema project within the W3C. The SPFE
                configuration namespace,
                    <b class="decoration-bold">http://spfeopentoolkit.org/ns/spfe-ot/config</b>
                states that it belongs to the SPFE Open Toolkit, and to the configuration project
                within the SPFE Open Toolkit.</p>

               <h2>Document types and namespaces</h2>
               <p>You may have noticed that to this point I have not used the phrase
                “document type”. I have used “vocabulary” to describe a
                set of XML elements designed to be used together. We may think of schemas and DTDs
                as defining document types, and that is what we generally use them to do. But
                actually, neither schemas not DTDs define document types. Rather, documents declare
                what type of document they are, by choosing what root element to use. Schemas and
                DTDs simply give them elements to choose from to form their root element, and in
                many cases, they give them several choices. </p>
               <p>With DTDs, any element defined in the DTD can be used by a document as a root
                element. Despite its name, a DTD is really defining a nested set of elements and a
                document is free to choose any element anywhere in that nest as its root element.
                XML Schemas are a bit more restrictive. You can only choose your root element from
                among those elements declared at the root of the schema. Elements declared inside
                type definitions cannot be used. This lets you write a schema with only one root
                element, which effectively confines it to defining a single document type. But one
                schema document can define multiple root elements. In fact, a schema or a DTD can
                define multiple root elements that share no child elements at all -- effectively
                defining multiple separate document types. </p>
               <p>In short, schemas, and namespaces, are all about elements. A document, and a document
                type, is something that we construct out of the raw material of nested elements that
                schemas and namespaces present to us. A document types is, therefore, not something
                with a strict definition in XML that we have to adhere to. It is something we can
                construct for ourselves in ways that meet our own needs. XML just says: here are
                elements, and here are the rules for elements and their names; make what you want
                out of them.</p>
               <p>This ability to define for ourselves what document types are is powerful, but
                potentially confusing. It also forces us to make decisions about what document types
                mean to us and what rules we are going to apply to them.</p>
               <p>One of those decisions is about the relationship between namespaces and document
                types. It is very tempting to think that every document type has a unique namespace and
                that is the end of the matter. A number of public document types, such as XML
                schema, XSLT, and HTML work this way. But there is no law that says it has to be
                this way. These public document types have very broad use and very firmly
                established semantics. And they don't share much with other public standards. Having
                unique namespaces for each of them makes sense because of the way they are used. </p>
               <p>But if you are setting up a <a href="structured-content.html" class="default" title="Essay: What is structured content?">structured writing</a> system, particularly a topic-based
                structured writing system, you are going to have multiple topic types. But each of
                those topic types is going to have a great many things in common. You are not going
                to have a whole different way of doing tables or lists or procedures across a family
                of closely related topic types. In fact, those topic types are probably going to
                share a whole bunch of elements that mean exactly the same thing in all of them. Why
                then should they be in different namespaces?</p>
               <p>There are three ways to handle this, which <a href="http://www.xfront.com/ZeroOneOrManyNamespaces.html" class="default" title="">this
                    essay</a> has named the Homogeneous, Heterogeneous, and Chameleon
                designs.</p>
