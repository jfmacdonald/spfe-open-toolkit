         <h3>Summary</h3>
               <p xmlns="">SPFE is intended to support a declarative approach to markup -- one in which authors
                use markup to declare what something is, rather than the give and instruction about
                how something is to be handled. Some other systems rely on imperative markup (which
                gives instructions). SPFE will allow for imperative markup, but is generally
                intended to avoid the need for it. </p>

            <p>In <a href="structured-content.html" class="default" title="Essay: What is structured content?">structured writing</a>, <a href="structured-content.html" class="default" title="Essay: What is structured content?">markup</a> is a means of
            inserting <a href="structured-content.html" class="default" title="Essay: What is structured content?">metadata</a> into content so that the content can be identified
            or manipulated by algorithms, and it ensure that the content meets a set of required
            constraints. This metadata can be divided into two broad categories, declarative and
            imperative.</p>
            <ol class="labeled-list">
               <li><p><b>Declarative markup - </b>Declares what a piece of content is, either its role in a document (such as
                    paragraph or list item) or what subject matter it refers to (such a an
                    ingredient in a recipe or a parameter in a API routine).</p></li>
               <li><p><b>Imperative markup - </b>Gives an instruction about how to handle the content under certain conditions.
                    For instance, a conditional statement that includes certain content when a
                    condition is true, or an instructions to reuse a piece of content by inserting
                    it at a particular point in a text. Links are also a form of imperative markup
                    as they tell the algorithm where to link to. </p></li>
            </ol>
            <p>The main reason for using imperative markup is to make it easy for writers to specify
            certain behaviors in the content without the need to create specific markup or
            specialized algorithms to support them. The inclusion of a standard set of imperative
            markup in a markup language, along with a corresponding set of algorithms to process the
            imperative markup, can allow an organization to manipulate content in useful ways
            without the need for additional structures or coding. DITA, in particular, makes
            extensive use of imperative markup, largely as a means to do content reuse.</p>
            <p>However, there are several downsides to the use of imperative markup:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>
                  <p>Imperative markup does not make objectively true statements about the content.
                    This make the content dependent on a particular markup and processing system.
                    Purely declarative markup is objectively true, and therefore the markup is
                    processable (with appropriate preprocessing) by any processing system. Content
                    that includes imperative markup cannot be easily moved to another system. </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>When imperatives are embedded in content, they are scattered through the content
                    set. Any change in policy that requires a change in the embedded imperatives,
                    which may involve editing many files scattered throughout the content set. For
                    instance, a change in linking policy could require editing virtually every file
                    in a content set. This involves a lot of work, is prone to errors and omissions,
                    and may trigger costly review and approval cycles.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>A markup system that uses imperative markup requires all authors, editors, and
                    maintainers of the content to understand the imperatives and their operation.
                    This means that they need to become experts not only in their subject and in
                    communicating about it, but in the publishing functions that are driven by the
                    imperatives. </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>Imperative markup is an instruction to be interpreted by an algorithm. That
                    means, in effect, that the imperative markup constitutes a programming language
                    embedded in the content. (This is not unusual. PHP and JavaScript are
                    programming languages that are commonly embedded in web pages.) However, if you
                    have more than one imperative element in your markup, you can run into issues
                    with the interactions between different imperatives. This potentially makes life
                    even more difficult for authors who now are being asked to think like
                    programmers (and who may not understand how the imperatives they have created
                    will be interpreted by the algorithm). It can also make like more difficult for
                    people writing algorithms to process the content, who now have to make sure that
                    the rules for handling then imperatives are clear, complete, and consistent,
                    which can be quite difficult if the are many ways in which the effects of the
                    imperatives can impinge on each other. </p>
               </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Many (not all) of the effects that can be achieved using imperative markup can also be
            achieved using declarative markup. Where imperative markup puts the instruction in the
            content, declarative markup puts information needed to make a decision into the content,
            but places the instructions itself in an algorithm. For example:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>
                  <p>Instead of attaching a link instruction to a phrase in the content (and
                    instruction to the processing software), declarative markup can specify the type
                    and subject matter that the phrase refers to (a declaration about the subject
                    matter) and leave it to an algorithm to find a resource to link to on that
                    subject when the content is published (<a href="../spfe-development/feature-how-linking-works.html" class="default" title="Feature: How linking works">soft linking</a>).</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>Instead of inserting an instruction to insert a reusable admonition component
                    above a procedure that is dangerous (an instruction to the processing software),
                    declarative markup can add an attribute to a procedure to state that it is
                    dangerous (a declaration about the subject matter) and leave it to an algorithm
                    to insert the appropriate admonition when the content is published.</p>
               </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The SPFE architecture is designed to facilitate the use of declarative markup as much as
            possible. Imperative markup can still be use (and if used is resolved in the
            resolve step of the <a href="../spfe-development/feature-synthesis.html" class="default" title="Feature: Synthesis">synthesis stage</a>), but the use
            of declarative markup is encouraged by the following features:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>
                  <p>Soft linking support means that direct links (imperative) in the content can be
                    replaced by annotations (declarative). Support for link resolution based on
                    annotation is built into the default SPFE build and the default EPPO-simple
                    scripts, so you don't need to write additional code to get soft linking. </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>The declarative approach often involves the use of subject-specific markup,
                    meaning you need to add additional markup and processing to your system to use
                    the declarative approach. SPFE's structures make it easy to add new structures
                    and their associates processing code to your system.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>SPFE's loosely coupled architecture and clear delineation of the role of each
                    processing step and stage provides a clear separation of concerns that makes it
                    easy to add processing code at the right place without having to worry about how
                    it will interact with other parts of the processing system.</p>
               </li>
            </ul>
