        <title>How the build system works</title>
        <p>The SPFE build system is highly configurable and flexible.</p>
        <p>The build tool for a SPFE build is a shell script (UNIX) or batch file (Windows) called
                <tool-name>spfe</tool-name>. This script takes two parameters, a
                <feature>configuration file</feature> and a <feature>build command</feature>. It
            runs an XSLT script (<file-name>spfe-ot/scripts/config/config.xsl</file-name>), which
            reads the specified configuration file, resolves any inclusions, and creates three
            outputs for each topic set:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>A fully resolved configuration file (in which all includes have been processed
                    and all defines have been expanded). This file is created in a /config directory
                    under the build directory (defined by the configuration element
                    <xml-element-name>/spfe/build/build-directory</xml-element-name>). This
                    configuration file is passed to every script in the rest of the build process,
                    making all the relevant configuration information available to all scripts. This
                    allows the scripts to have a uniform interface, which reduces the need to
                        <task>customize build rules</task> when writing your own scripts.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>A generated XSLT script file for each stage of the build. These files are
                    generated by creating a wrapper file that imports each script listed in the
                    appropriate sections of  the configuration element
                    <xml-element-name>/spfe/scripts</xml-element-name>. These generated scripts are
                    created in the build directory.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>An ANT build file, which contains ANT property and files definitions, and imports
                    either the custom build rules (if specified by
                    <xml-element-name>/spfe/build/build-rules</xml-element-name>) or the default
                    SPFE build rules file,
                        <file-name>spfe-ot/1.0/build-tools/spfe-rules.xml</file-name>. The build
                    file is created in the directory spfebuild/temp under the user's HOME directory
                    (this is hard coded in the <tool-name>spfe</tool-name> build tool).</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Next, the <tool-name>spfe</tool-name> build tool runs ANT on the generated ANT build
            file. What happens next depends on the kind of build file the
                <file-name>config.xsl</file-name> script created. If the configuration file did not
            contain a <xml-element-name>/spfe/doc-set</xml-element-name> element, it runs the build
            command for a single topic set. If it found a
            <xml-element-name>/spfe/doc-set</xml-element-name> element, it creates a build file that
            runs the build command for each topic set listed in the
            <xml-element-name xpath="/spfe/doc-set">/spfe/doc-set</xml-element-name> element.
            Essentially, each topic set build is done independently using the same process described
            here, except that in this case it is the generated ANT build file that runs the process,
            rather than the <tool-name>spfe</tool-name> build tool.</p>
        <p>The following build command are available:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><code>cat</code>: Generates the <feature>link catalogs</feature> for the topic
                    set. The link catalogs must be built first in order for links to be created by
                    the build.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><code>draft</code>: Generates a draft build. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><code>final</code>: Generates a final build.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><code>clean</code>: Removes all the temporary files and output files from
                    previous builds except for link catalog files.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you make changes to scripts or configuration files, you should always run clean before
            running a new draft, since the dependency checking in the build does not cover the
            scripts and configuration file. In the Alpha version of the toolkit, it is not a given
            that it covers all the things it should cover, so when in doubt, clean before you build
            a draft. The tools will force a clean before building a final, just to be certain.</p>
        <p>From this point on, the build runs each build step according to the order specified in
            either the <file-name>spfe-rules.xml</file-name> file or in the custom build rules file
            specified by the <xml-element-name>/spfe/build/build-rules</xml-element-name> element in
            the configuration file. Each step reads one or more source files and outputs one or more
            XML files that form the input to the next set, or the final (possibly non-XML)
            output.</p>
            <p>In general the build order is synthesis, presentation, formatting, and (if necessary)
            encoding. However, in practice more steps may be involved. For instance, the creation of
            the link catalogs is a separate step run on the synthesis files. The presentation
            scripts then take both the synthesis files and the link catalog files as input and
            outputs the presentation file or files which are the input to the formatting stage. If
            the build uses content from sources other than content created by authors, (for example,
            the build for the SPFE Configuration Reference extracts content from the configuration
            schema), extraction is a separate step at the synthesis stage.</p>
                <p>The synthesis, presentation, formatting, encoding sequence, from which SPFE takes
            its name, is therefore more of a general outline of the process than a strictly
            prescribed set of steps. The overriding SPFE principle is that each stage of the process
            should do only one thing. This helps ensure the simplicity of each step and the code
            that implements it, and improves modularity and reuse of the code.</p>
