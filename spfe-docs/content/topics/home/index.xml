        <title>SPFE Open Toolkit Documentation</title>
        <p>The <string-ref id-ref="product"/> is a toolkit for building
            content creation systems using the <feature>SPFE architecture</feature>. </p>
        <p>The SPFE architecture is designed to facilitate the creation of structured writing
            systems that use a <concept>bottom-up information architecture</concept>. </p>
        <p>Bottom-up information architectures are common on the Web. Both wikis and blogging
            platforms, as well as many Web CMS work on the bottom-up pattern. However, there are no
            bottom-up systems based on markup-based structured writing principles (some
            database-based structured bottom-up systems exist). The <string-ref id-ref="product"/>
            is designed to fill this gap.</p>
        <p>The SPFE-OT is also capable of creating
            <concept specifically="top-down information architecture">top-down</concept> and
            hybrid <concept specifically="top-down information architecture">top-down</concept>/<concept specifically="bottom-up information architecture">bottom-up information architectures</concept>.</p>
        <section>
            <title>The current state of the SPFE documentation</title>
            <p>The SPFE documentation has been developed to date as a testbed for the SPFE Open
                Toolkit. It is not complete and it may contain information that no longer describes
                the current state of the toolkit or the accompanying schemas. </p>
            <p>The biggest questions you probably have about SPFE are why it was developed in the
                first place given that we already have so many structured writing tools such as
                DocBook, DITA, Markdown, reStructuredText, LaTeX, and ASCIIDoc. The best answers to
                those questions are to be found in two books I have written. (Both books came about,
                essentially, to explain why SPFE, and writing the two books has delayed work on SPFE
                itself for a long time. The books are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p><link-external href="https://xmlpress.net/publications/eppo/">Every Page is Page One: Topic-based Writing for Technical Communication and the Web</link-external>,
                        XML Press, 2013.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Structured Writing: Rhetoric and Process, XML Press, forthcoming 2018 (Check
                        the XML Press site to see if it is out yet:
                        <url>https://xmlpress.net</url>.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The <italic>Every Page is Page One</italic> book describes an approach to information
                design which I call <concept>bottom-up information architecture</concept>, which is
                based on the user behavior of finding content principally by search, which can throw
                the reader into any page in a content set (thus, Every Page is Page One). Fully
                supporting this requires an approach that makes every page work as the first page
                the reader sees and supports adequate navigational aids for readers to move onward
                to other topics they may need. Wikipedia is an excellent example of a bottom-up
                information architecture. Most current structured writing tools do not support
                bottom-up information architecture well. (Wikis are bottom-up by nature, but also
                unstructured.) SPFE is designed to support the creation of bottom-up information
                architectures. </p>
            <p>The <italic>Structured Writing</italic> book provided an overview of structured
                writing techniques and systems, but it highlights an approach to structured writing
                which I call the subject-domain approach. Most current structured writing systems
                are either wholly or principally document-domain systems. The subject domain
                approach has many advantages, both in terms of rhetoric and process, and it is
                particularly advantageous when creating a bottom-up information architecture. SPFE
                is designed to support the use of subject-domain structured writing. </p>
            <p>The SPFE documentation is intended to be an example of bottom-up information
                architecture, but it isn't there yet. My intention is to return to the SPFE
                documentation once the <italic>Structured Writing</italic> book is complete. </p>

            <title>The role of SAM</title>
            <p>Along the way, the writing of the <italic>Structured Writing</italic> book gave birth
                to another project, to develop a alternative markup language for structured writing.
                The vast majority of structured writing today is done in XML using a structured XML
                editor which presents a pseudo-WYSIWYG graphical editing environment to the writer.
                This is inherently a document-domain writing environment. It has
                <link-external href="https://everypageispageone.com/2016/01/28/why-does-xml-suck/">many problems</link-external>
                even for working in the document domain, but it is even more difficult to work in
                when writing in the subject domain. Many people today prefer to work in lightweight
                markup languages such as MarkDown which you can create easily using a simple text
                editor. However, all current lightweight markup languages are simple document domain
                languages. There was no lightweight markup language that could be used to create
                specific subject-domain semantics for writing about specific subjects. Something new
                was needed to make writing in the subject domain easy for writers. </p>
            <p>For this purpose, I created
                <link-external href="https://mbakeranalecta.github.io/sam/index.html">SAM</link-external>
                (<italic>Semantic Authoring Markdown</italic>, or
                <italic>Semantic Authoring Markup</italic> as you please). The
                <italic>Structured Writing</italic> book is written SAM and used SAM for most of its
                examples. You can find SAM at <url>https://mbakeranalecta.github.io/sam/</url>. SAM
                is not intended to completely replace XML, which is more general than SAM and works
                fine for most of the things it is used for. SAM is intended as a front-end authoring
                language for structured writing systems that would still use XML internally. The
                current version of SPFE is still basically and XML-based system and will remain XML
                based in all of its internals. It has basic support for SAM as an input language,
                and this will be expanded so that SAM will become the main way to write content in
                SPFE. XML will always be supported as an authoring language as well, however. It is
                part of the design intent for SPFE that it should be as catholic as possible in the
                formats it accepts. </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>Writing in a SPFE Environment</title>
            <p>SPFE is intended to make structured writing as simple as possible for writers by
                minimizing how much they need to understand about the publishing system, and by
                minimizing the need to understand to interact with the overall body of content that
                an organization maintains. Traditional content management approaches of ten require
                substantial knowledge of both the system itself and the whole corpus of content in
                order to participate fully in content creation. SPFE is designed to avoid this by
                creating a publish and content management environment that is driven by
                <concept>metadata</concept> about the subject matter of the content (subject-domain
                markup) -- something that the author naturally understands.</p>
            <p>Structured authoring is also easier if the structures that authors are asked to
                create are simple and related as specifically as possible to the subject matter they
                are writing about. SPFE is designed to work best with small subject-specific
                structures, and to make it as easy as possible to
                <task specifically="create structures">design and implement such structures</task>.</p>
        </section>
<section>
    <title>Schemas</title>
    <p>As a <concept>structured writing</concept> system, SPFE works with content that conforms to a
                set of formal rules known as a <concept>schema</concept>. Schemas define which
                content structures can be used in which situations. Successful
                <task>processing of content</task> depends on the content conforming to both the
                letter and the spirit of the appropriate schema. </p>
    <p>However, unlike the DocBook and DITA systems, SPFE is not based on a particular schema. Rather,
            SPFE is a modular content processing architecture that can be used with a variety of
            schemas. However, SPFE does make certain presumptions about how schemas will be
                written. In particular it expects a <concept specifically="declarative markup">declarative style of
                markup</concept> in which the document markup does not contain any publishing or
            content management directives. </p>
        <p>To enable users to get up to speed quickly, and to provide a baseline of functionality
            for building SPFE-compatible schemas, <string-ref id-ref="product"
            /> includes the <feature>EPPO Simple</feature> schema set. EPPO Simple is a highly
            modularized set of schemas and associated processing that you can use directly or as the
            basis for <task>creating your own schemas</task>.</p>
