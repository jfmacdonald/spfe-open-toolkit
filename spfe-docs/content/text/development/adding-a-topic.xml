        <title>Adding a new topic</title>
        <understanding>
            <p>A <feature>topic</feature> is the basic unit of content that is presented to the user. If you are trying to create a reusable content building block that is not a full topic, you should be creating a <feature>fragment</feature>, a <feature>string</feature>, or a <feature>text object</feature>.</p>
       </understanding>
       <planning>
           <planning-question>
               <planning-question-title>What do I need to add a new topic?</planning-question-title>
                <planning-question-body>
                   <p>Before you add a topic, you must decide what topic type schema to use.</p>
                    <p>You can use an existing schema and a topic set that uses
                                the schema can include your topic. If your topic uses a new schema or a schema that does
                                not have an associated topic set, it will not appear in a
                                documentation set until a topic set includes it.
                    </p>
                </planning-question-body>
            </planning-question>
       </planning>
<doing>
    <p>To add a new topic, create a file for your topic that includes the content that follows the
                schema you selected. A topic set includes a topic file based on the attributes of
                the <config-setting>/spfe/topic-set/sources/authored-content</config-setting> element in the topic
                configuration file.</p>
                    <p>If you store your topic source file in a directory that is already included
                        in the topic set configuration file, the build system automatically includes
                        the topic in the topic set and it appears under the topic set in the table
                        of contents.</p>

                    <p>If you store your topic file in a new directory, the new directory path must be added to the
                        <config-setting>/spfe/topic-set/sources/authored-content</config-setting> element of the topic set
                        configuration file.</p>
    
  
    <p>When you run the <tool-name>spfe</tool-name> build tool, if your topic appears in the documentation set under the correct topic
                set in the table of contents and contains the correct content, you have successfully added a topic to the documentation set.</p>
