                A container element for information on a {content set}(feature). A content set is a collection of {topic sets}(feature). To define a content set, you list the configuration files for each topic set in the content set using a {/content-set/topic-sets/topic-set}(config-setting) element.
                    
                To build a full content set, you simply run the {spfe}(tool-name) build tool on a {content-set}(config-setting "/content-set") file. The build tool will then run whichever build command you have specified on all the topic sets in the content set, as well as creating the files that belong to the content set as a whole.
